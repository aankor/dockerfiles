[Factor](https://www.factorcode.org) is a [concatenative](http://www.concatenative.org), stack-based programming language (forth like).


The base image is generating by nixery.dev. It uses [NixOS](http://nixos.org) Linux distribution with a purely functional package manager which is the best friend of docker.


Factor compiles and runs packages (vocabularies) like a modern scripting language. There is a deployment tool for generating executable binary, but there are some problems with it. Anyways, the compilation is fast and all batteries are included.


Guaranteed to work with (starterkit-factor)[https://github.com/icfpcontest2020/starterkit-factor].
